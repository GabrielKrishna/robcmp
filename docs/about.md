This is a site for documenting the Robcmp project (https://github.com/thborges/robcmp). Robcmp is a frontend compiler, based on LLVM, developed to help students taking the Compiler course in the Computer Science bachelor. The programming language is engineered around Educational Robotics and we plan to introduce it in our research projects. The compiler is not feature-complete yet but was used already to code some robots using AVR processors.

I'm a professor at a Brazilian university called UFJ (Former Jata√≠ Regional, UFG, GO, Brazil). My research is focused on distributed spatial data processing, computer science algorithms and compilers. I do electronics and 3d printing as hobbies.

You can find some of my code, tutorials, and projects in this site, as well as in my profiles  at:
